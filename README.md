# Stress Level Analysis Based on Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors

A data science project analyzing the relationship between stress levels and socioeconomic &amp; environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, unemployment rate, salary distribution, demographics, and more. Using statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover patterns and predictive insights.


## Project Overview
This project explores how socioeconomic and environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, unemployment rates, salaries, and demographics impact stress levels. By analyzing these relationships, I aim to identify key contributors to stress and potential patterns across different regions.


## Motivation
Stress is something many of us experience, but it's also becoming a major public health issue worldwide. A recent survey ranked it just behind cancer and mental health as one of the biggest concerns, with countries like South Korea and Turkey reporting especially high levels. Younger people are often more affected, but even a significant number of older adults struggle with stress. This makes me wonder—what’s driving this rise in stress? Could factors like economic instability or climate conditions play a role? That’s what I want to explore in this project.

## Data Sources & Collection Plan

We will collect publicly available data on:
- **Stress-related statistics** from global health surveys
- **Weather conditions** from climate databases
- **Economic indicators** such as unemployment and salary data from government reports
- 
These datasets will be complementory, updated and enriched.

- **April 18:** Data collection and exploratory analysis
- **May 23:** Machine learning implementation
- **May 30:** Final project submission


## Tools & Technologies
