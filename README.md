# **Stress Level Analysis Based on Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors**

A data science project analyzing the relationship between **stress levels** and **socioeconomic & environmental factors** such as temperature, unemployment rates, salary distribution, cost of living, and demographics. Using statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover patterns and predictive insights.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project explores how external factors—including **economic indicators and climate conditions**—impact stress levels. By analyzing data from multiple sources, I aim to **identify key contributors to stress and develop predictive models**.

### **Key Research Questions**
- How do **unemployment rates and salary distribution** impact reported stress levels?
- Do **environmental conditions** (temperature, rainfall, pollution) correlate with higher stress levels?
- Are there **regional or demographic differences** in stress patterns?
- Does the **cost of living** influence mental health outcomes?

---

## **📌 Motivation**
Stress is something many of us experience, but it's also becoming a major public health issue worldwide.  
A recent survey ranked it just behind **cancer and mental health** as one of the biggest concerns, with countries like **South Korea and Turkey** reporting especially high levels.  
Younger people are often more affected, but even a significant number of older adults struggle with stress.  
This makes me wonder—**what’s driving this rise in stress?**  
Could factors like **economic instability or climate conditions** play a role?  
**That’s what I want to explore in this project.**

## **📌 Project Scope**
### **Country as a Parameter**
Instead of limiting the analysis to specific countries, this project considers **all available regions** in the dataset and uses **country as a parameter** in analysis. However, **comparisons will focus on**:
- 🇺🇸 **United States**
- 🇩🇪 **Germany**
- 🇰🇷 **South Korea**

This approach provides **flexibility** while still allowing deeper regional insights.

### **Comparison Factors**
- **Economic Factors:** Salary distribution, unemployment, cost of living.
- **Environmental Factors:** Temperature, precipitation, air pollution.
- **Demographic Trends:** Stress levels by age, gender, and location.

This ensures a **broad but structured** analysis.

---

## **📌 Hypotheses**
1️⃣ **Air Pollution & Extreme Weather → Increased Stress**  
   - Regions with **higher air pollution** or **frequent extreme weather (heat waves, storms, etc.)** may have **higher stress levels**, possibly due to **health concerns, discomfort, and disruptions in daily life**.  

2️⃣ **Social Media & Stress Perception**  
   - **Higher social media usage → Increased reported stress**  
     - Countries with **higher social media engagement** may show **higher self-reported stress levels**, possibly due to **information overload, comparison anxiety, or exposure to negative news**.

## **📊 Data Collection & EDA**

### 🧼 Data Cleaning Summary

Before performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we applied structured cleaning operations across all datasets to ensure consistency and reliability:

#### ✅ `social_media_stress.csv`
- Converted `Age` column to numeric format
- Removed rows with missing or invalid age values
- Cleaned dataset used to analyze usage time and engagement patterns by emotion

#### ✅ `Stress_Data.csv`
- Preserved full data but grouped by `Country` to calculate proportions of stress levels (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`)
- Used for country-level comparisons and merged with economic indicators

#### ✅ `World_Economic_Data.csv`
- Removed percentage symbols and commas from fields such as `Unemployment rate`, `CPI`, `Life expectancy`, and `Tax revenue (%)`
- Converted cleaned columns to numeric types
- Prepared for merging with stress summaries to enable correlation analysis

#### ✅ `Gallup_Stress_Report_2024.pdf`
- Extracted emotional indicators like `Stress`, `Worry`, `Anger`, `Sadness`, `Loneliness` and global experience indices
- Manually converted structured values into tabular form
- Saved as `gallup_emotion_data_2023.csv` for further use

#### ✅ `OECD_Income_Data.pdf`
- Sample disposable income values were extracted for selected countries
- Used to support high-level comparison between income and emotional health patterns

### 🔗 Merged Dataset Overview

We created a merged dataset combining **country-level stress proportions** from `Stress_Data.csv` with **economic indicators** from `World_Economic_Data.csv`.

📄 **File:** `merged_stress_economics.csv`  
🧩 **Purpose:** To analyze how **economic and healthcare metrics** (e.g., life expectancy, unemployment, physician density) correlate with the **proportion of people reporting high stress**.

This merged dataset was the foundation for our **correlation heatmap** and multiple cross-variable analyses.

### 📊 EDA: Daily Usage Time vs Dominant Emotion

We explored how much time users spend on social media and how it relates to their dominant emotional state.

### 🧪 EDA: Likes, Comments & DMs vs Emotion

We explored how different types of social media engagement (likes, comments, and messages) vary based on users' dominant emotional state using violin plots.

📄 **Code file**: [`eda_social_engagement.py`](eda/eda_social_engagement.py)

🧠 **Insights:**
- **Happiness** and **Anxiety** show broader spread in likes and message counts
- **Anger** and **Sadness** are associated with more DMs and comment activity
- Emotional state is reflected in the quantity and variability of online engagement
