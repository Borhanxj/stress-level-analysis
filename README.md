# **Stress Level Analysis Based on Socioeconomic and Environmental Factors**

A data science project analyzing the relationship between stress levels and socioeconomic & environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, unemployment rates, salary distribution, demographics, and more. Using statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover patterns and predictive insights.

---

## **Project Overview**
This project explores how external factors—including economic indicators and climate conditions—impact stress levels. By analyzing data from multiple sources, I aim to identify key contributors to stress and develop predictive insights.

### **Key Research Questions**
- How do unemployment rates and salary distribution impact reported stress levels?
- Do environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, pollution) correlate with higher stress levels?
- Are there regional or demographic differences in stress patterns?

---

## **Motivation**
Stress is a major public health issue worldwide. Recent surveys have highlighted increasing stress levels, particularly among younger populations. Countries like South Korea and Germany report some of the highest stress levels globally. Economic instability and climate conditions might play a role, and this project aims to explore these connections.

## **Project Scope**
This analysis will focus on **comparing stress levels** between different regions based on socioeconomic and environmental factors.

### **Regions of Interest**
- **Primary Focus Countries:** 🇺🇸 **United States**, 🇩🇪 **Germany**, 🇰🇷 **South Korea**  
  - These countries were selected due to their **abundant and high-quality datasets** on stress, economics, and environment.
- **Additional Regions for Comparison:** 🌍 If data is available, I may include **France, Canada, or Australia**.

### **Comparison Factors**
- **Cross-country comparison:** How do stress levels differ between different economic models (e.g., USA vs. Germany vs. South Korea)?
- **Urban vs. Rural Stress:** Do people in urban areas report higher stress due to economic and environmental factors?
- **Age & Gender Trends:** Are younger people more stressed across different cultures?
- **Environmental Influence:** Does extreme weather (e.g., high temperatures, pollution) correlate with stress levels?

This scope ensures a **focused yet flexible approach**, allowing for additional regions to be analyzed if data is available.

## **Dataset & Parameters**
This project analyzes the relationship between stress levels and various socioeconomic and environmental factors. Below are the key parameters used:

### **1️⃣ Stress-Level Indicators**
- **Survey-based stress scores** (e.g., from Gallup or WHO)
- **Mental health statistics** (e.g., anxiety, depression prevalence)

### **2️⃣ Environmental Factors**
- **Temperature** (°C) – Monthly average temperatures
- **Precipitation** (mm) – Rainfall per region
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)** – Pollution levels

### **3️⃣ Socioeconomic Indicators**
- **Unemployment rate (%)** – National/Regional job market conditions
- **Salary distribution** – Median salaries and income inequality
- **Cost of living index** – General affordability of daily life

These parameters will be used for **data analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning models**.

---

## **Data Sources & Collection Plan**
I will collect and combine publicly available datasets to analyze stress factors.

### **Planned Datasets:**
1. **Stress-related statistics**
   - Global stress indices (e.g., WHO, Gallup)
   - Mental health surveys

2. **Weather Conditions**
   - Temperature, precipitation, pollution (NOAA, NASA, local meteorological data)

3. **Economic Indicators**
   - Unemployment rates (World Bank, IMF)
   - Salary distribution (OECD, National Statistics)
   - Cost of living indices

### **Data Enrichment Plan**
- Cross-referencing stress levels with socioeconomic and weather data.
- Aggregating data at regional/national levels.
- Handling missing values and inconsistencies.

---

## **Methodology**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization.
   - Correlation analysis to identify patterns.

2. **Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Analysis**
   - T-tests, ANOVA, and regression models.

3. **Machine Learning Approaches**
   - Clustering (e.g., K-Means) for stress pattern grouping.
   - Regression (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for predicting stress levels.
